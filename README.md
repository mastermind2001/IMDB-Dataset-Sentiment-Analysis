# IMDB-Dataset-Sentiment-Analysis

## Overview

It is a simple classifier built using LSTM network to classify sentiment of movie reviews (Positive or negative).

## Project Details

I have used Keras (an open source neural network library) to build this classifier. The model (model.ipynb) contains a self-trained LSTM network.

I've got around <strong>88% accuracy</strong> in the Test set.
